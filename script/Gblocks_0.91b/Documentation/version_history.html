In addition, gap-only positions are removed previous to the analysis.<br>			- It can now process alignments with only two positions (previously the minimum was five) or only two sequences (previously the minimum was three), and path files with only one sequence (previously the minimum was two).<br>- It is possible to process path files containing alignments with different number of sequences; in this case the program calculates defaults for every alignment.<br>- The block parameters and saving menus have been simplified. As a consequence of the block parameters simplification and other changes, the results with defaults are slightly different from those of version 0.73b.<br>			- A bug that would crash the program under certain rare conditions in the alignment ends has been fixed.</p>		<p><b>Gblocks 0.73b</b>:<br>						- First release.</p>		<p></p>		<p><a href="http://www.embl-heidelberg.de/~castresa/Gblocks/Gblocks.html">Gblocks Home</a></p>		<p><a href="http://www.embl-heidelberg.de/~castresa/Gblocks/Documentation/Gblocks_documentation.html">Gblocks On-line Documentation</a></p>		<p><a href="http://www.embl-heidelberg.de/~castresa">Jose Castresana Home Page</a></p>		<p></p>	</body></html>
